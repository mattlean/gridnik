# Gridnik

Gridnik plugin for an [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) that extends the program's ability to create grids.

The plugin's name is based on Dutch graphic designer [Wim Crouwel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Crouwel) who was known by his friends as Mr. Gridnik, a nickname given to him due to his obsession with grids.
